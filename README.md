## How to Run the Server

0. if you cloned this repository, make sure to create a file called `.env` to store a variable called `PORT` and give it a value (free port, like 3000) that is different from your backend's PORT value.

1. Run `npm install` to install all the needed dependencies.

2. Simply run `npm start`.
